Live Website: https://macdonald91.github.io/New-York-Blog-Post/

Welcome to the New York City Blog, a passion project born from the vibrant streets of the Big Apple and a deep dive into the power of Semantic HTML5!

✨ Project Overview
This isn't just another blog; it's a love letter to New York City, crafted with a keen eye on modern web standards. As part of a Full-Stack Engineer framework from Codecademy, this project demonstrates the elegance and structure that semantic HTML brings to web development. My goal was to create an informative and engaging experience for anyone curious about NYC, all while meticulously utilizing HTML elements that convey meaning and improve accessibility.

🚀 Features
Dive into the heart of New York through thoughtfully structured content:

📰 Blog Section (<section>, <article>, <p>): Explore fascinating facts about NYC's five boroughs, iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, and the bustling Times Square.

🖼️ Media Showcase (<section>, <video>, <audio>, <img>, <embed>): Immerse yourself with visual and auditory experiences, from a mesmerizing NYC skyline timelapse to the authentic sounds of city traffic.

🍔 Local Flavors (<aside>, <ol>, <p>): Discover the must-try culinary delights that make NYC a food lover's paradise.

🌐 Intuitive Navigation (<nav>, <ul>, <li>, <a>): Seamlessly move between different sections of the blog (Blog, Media, About).

🌟 Structured Content (<header>, <main>, <footer>): The entire site is built upon a robust semantic foundation, ensuring logical content flow and enhanced readability for both humans and search engines.

📸 Image with Caption (<figure>, <img>, <figcaption>): Images are presented with clear, descriptive captions, adding context and improving understanding.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 (Semantic Markup): The core of this project, focusing on elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <figure>, <footer>, <video>, <audio>, and <iframe> (represented by <embed> in your code for the image).

CSS3: Provides the styling to bring the Big Apple to life, though the primary focus of this exercise was HTML structure.

🚦 How to Run This Project
It's super simple to get this NYC experience up and running on your local machine:

Clone the Repository (if applicable):

git clone <your-repository-url>


Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd new-york-city-blog  # Or whatever your project folder is named


Open in Your Browser:
Simply open the index.html file (or blog.html if that's your main entry point) in your web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

That's it! The magic of semantic HTML and a touch of CSS will unfold before your eyes.

💡 Key Learnings & Highlights
